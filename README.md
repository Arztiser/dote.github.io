# WARNING ⚠️!

We now thought of helping people setup their own instance, but we are not going to spoonfeed you code. Always remember to search the error on google and stack overflow before asking us. We believe in FOSS but we are not going to spoonfeed you. Also do not spam for getting your help, we are humans, not bots, therefore we are not always available 24/7. So do not spam for getting your attention.

Also note that this codebase is under development, so it's not meant for public usage at the moment (Its usable for us, but not for other's deployments).

Please keep **bugs**, **issues** and **code related subjects** in our issues and pull requests. If they are posted on our Discord server they will be **IGNORED**. The website feedback looks at your likes, dislikes and suggestions on the front end, but not for bugfixes or other problems. Please bring them here if you really want help/to help.

---

This project is open source to allow us to be transparent in our work and to prove we do not have bad intentions. If you're trying to run it, please only do so if you're testing or helping us.
If your instance is public, make sure to let us know about your website in our support server.

> Thank you for your time, love and support that make this project possible!
