## Note

When you're forking this and redeploying, please do this if you edit either the front end or the backend:
1. Rename "Made from ♥️ from Rovel Stars" to "Based on RDL" or "Forked from RDL" and add a link to this repo.
2. Remove arc.io from `src/views/partials/header.ejs`. And you can't add any ads or your own arc.io on the site.
3. Remove DCMA from `footer.ejs` and you can't add your own too.

**If you don't follow all these points, you're not following the license.**

# Setup
1. fill in the envs
2. run `npm i && npm run build && npm start`
3. Enjoy!

This project is open sourced for allowing us to be transparent in our work, and to prove that we are good. If you're trying to setup it, please do so only if you're testing it or helping us.
If you're running it publicly, as a self deployment, make sure to let us know about your website link in our support server.

> Thank you for your time and love that made us make this possible!
